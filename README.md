## How to Run This Application:
## Save the Code:
Save the code above into a Python file (e.g., password_tool.py).

## Install Libraries:
If you haven't already, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

## Bash

pip install tk 
pip install nltk
## Download NLTK Data:
After installing nltk, you need to download the words corpus. Run this command in your terminal:

## Bash

python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('words')"
This will download the necessary dictionary data for the password analyzer to detect common words.

## Run the App:
Navigate to the directory where you saved password_tool.py in your terminal and run:

## Bash

python password_tool.py
You will see a Tkinter window appear. Type in the "Enter Password" field to see live feedback, and click "Generate New Strong Password" to get a secure alternative.

## Key Features and Improvements:
## Live Feedback:
Strength and suggestions update as you type.

## Clear Categories:
"Very Weak," "Weak," "Moderate," "Strong," "Very Strong" with color-coded labels.

## Comprehensive Suggestions:
Provides actionable advice based on length, character types, common patterns, and dictionary word usage.

## Strong Password Generator:
Creates random passwords that include a mix of character types and are of a good length (default 16 characters).

## Copy to Clipboard:
Easily copy the generated password for use.

## Modern Styling:
Uses ttk.Style for a slightly more modern look.

NLTK Integration: Uses the words corpus to check for dictionary words, significantly improving the analysis.
